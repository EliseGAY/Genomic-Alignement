##### Make alignement on supercalculator of sequences fasta against fasta with alignments tools

##### BLAT
Use to align sequences with high similarity level by local and fast alignement run

Sequences might be protein of nucleiq

sbatch blat.sh

##### BLAST

Use to align sequences in various ways (pairwise or by using NCBI database).

Sequences might be protein of nucleiq

Inconvenient : long run

sbatch blast.sh

##### MUMMER

Use to align whole genome, more accurate than BLAT, but less modulable.
